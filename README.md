# ECE1779 Project #2: Megaphone

_A location-based, community-driven question and answer service built atop Google App Engine._

## Future Work

Some ideas for future work include the following:

- Make better use of [Memcache](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/memcache/)

- Use MapReduce to iterate over all questions and answers, determine trending/popular ones, to help identify hot activity zones.

- Benchmark performance/load characteristics to expose bottlenecks

- Improve Search & Prospective Search features

- Multiple Prospective Search locations per user

- Add more features for a richer user experience
